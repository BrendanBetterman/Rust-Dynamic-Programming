# Compiling fib2

The suggestion I made in the comments are in the crate fib2.

To compile it just run: 

```bash
cargo build
```

To run:

```bash
cargo run
```

# Installing Rust

Needs rust installed. Which is available in the official [rustlang website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Just run the script and everything is installed.
